             If you've made it to this website you must know that I am Zachary Vandeputte. Let me introduce myself -

        <div class="subabout1">
            <p>
                I am a soon to be 2022 graduate studying philosophy and political science at Indiana University - Bloomington.
                I first created this website while studying computer science with the aim of it to originally be a sort of storage facility for my projects.
                Life had other plans as I struggled with a  diagnosis of epilepsy in my first-year spring semester. It was difficult to keep up with my peers while retaining
                the enjoyment I originally found in computer programming. I've since decided that stuyding philosophy and political science have provided me with a deep sense
                of fulfillment that I sought studying computer science. 
            </p>

            <p>
                This website is dedicated to whatever career lay beyond the horizon of my future and I hope to continue to update and change this about section as my life changes. 
                Studying philosophy and political science have allowed me to learn about myself and the world around me, making me even more confident in my future - whatever that may be.
                I hope to gain career experience working for a company that does meaningful work and recognizes my worth as a person and lifelong student; I wish to enrich my life,
                skill-set, and understanding of both technical and soft skills as I help enable said company accomplish its meaningful goal.
